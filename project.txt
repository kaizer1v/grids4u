Strategy

Q*: What is the problem statement?
A: Whenever I start off buildling a new web application or website, I need to start over a lot of things again, repeating my efforts and consuming
	unnecessary time.


Q*: What is the aim of the Project?
A: It aims to give the user starting off a new project with handy tools, how-to stuff and ready-made code for components that can be used easily.


Q: What is it that you intend to solve?
A: I want a central location to find tips, how-tos and components that are frequently used to make my tasks easier and faster.


Q: These are already available on the internet, why rebuild the wheel?
A: Yes, but the cost of searching for the right ones, customizing them is too high.


Q: How do you plan to make it easy?
A: Firstly, I will be concentrating on the functionality and how-to build your own components. This will give the end user the flexibility to
	customize and use it however they want to.
